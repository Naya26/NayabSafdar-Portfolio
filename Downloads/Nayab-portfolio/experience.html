            My experience so far lives at the intersection of data, design, and people — from accessibility-focused UX work and research, to roles that support and guide students through big transitions.

                  I helped improve an accessibility-focused tech discovery platform by redesigning how users navigate and find assistive tools.
                  A lot of my work centered on creating wireframes, tightening up interaction flows, and making sure the interface felt intuitive and welcoming —
                  especially for people who rely on accessible design to use technology comfortably.
                  I collaborated closely with the design team, iterated on feedback, and contributed to updates that made tool discovery feel smoother and more efficient.

                  At the CREED Lab, I supported research exploring how young people interact with generative AI.
                  I worked on qualitative analysis — coding transcripts, identifying patterns across interviews, and helping surface themes around what students find exciting, confusing, or concerning about AI tools.
                  The role taught me how to turn open-ended, messy real-world perspectives into clearer insights that can inform both future research and design decisions.

                  As an Orientation Advisor, I welcomed new students to UMD and helped them navigate everything from schedules to campus resources.
                  My goal was to make the transition feel a little less overwhelming — creating space where students felt comfortable asking questions and sharing concerns.
                  I led group activities, facilitated conversations, and acted as a point of contact for both practical guidance and reassurance.

                  I worked with students learning how to work with data using tools like Python, R, and SQL.
                  A big part of the role was meeting students where they were — helping them debug assignments, unpack tricky concepts, and feel more confident working with real datasets.
                  I supported grading, answered questions in and out of class, and tried to make data feel less intimidating and more like a skill they could actually own.
